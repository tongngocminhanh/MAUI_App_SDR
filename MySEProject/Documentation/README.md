# ML22-23-8 Implement the SDR representation in the MAUI application
## Introduction
.NET Multi-platform App User Interface (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framwork, dealing with real-time problems. This project requires the implement of a MAUI app for visualizing the SDR representation. The app is compatible in Windows, Android, and IOS devices. This involves generating a UI for parameters setting and file input with XAML, binding data for application and logic with Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and XAML, using of Maui.Graphics for a new SDR drawing library. The scope of the project is to show the hardware and software requirements, how to implement the MAUI app, evaluate the test results and what could be developed in the future.
